# Text-Mining-Project
In this project our team created a personality (Meyers-Briggs) Predictor using reddit comments from a data set pulled from kaggle. The link to the data set is https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type
In summary, Our model with the most accuracy was a MLP with a 74% accuracy. In the end of our code a person can put comments a resume and try it out for themselves.
